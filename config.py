You're helping rewriting the resume for a new role.

## context
{context}

## Job description (summary):
{jd_txt}

## Current resume (summary):
{resume_txt}

Give me a updated and optimized ATS-friendly resume. 
The first thing you need to do is identify the key skills required and make sure those skills are included and reflected in the skills section and work experience. Be sure that if they require to have certain skill for certain years, you need to include that skill in the appropriate positions so that it can cover required period.
 - Please be sure to make every work experience unique and natural, realistic, professional after choosing best fit with job description from the context and current resume experience and real world projects I build by using real world projects in corresponding company in a way that don't list duties but includes handling which task using what technologies or tools and achieve which result like this.
 - If you find that the projects in my resume or context are great fit for the job description, then you should include them. If you can't find any relevant project in my original resume, then you should make up a real, natural-sounding work experience using your imagination and reflect its project name and the result. Just surprise me, I believe in you.
 - I mean, not explicitly specifying the project but reflecting project name in the work experience and the result with accurate mathematical result 
 - Increase the number of experience for each position to nearly 7 to 8  and hey remember to use unique and real world project names for many experience as possible.
 - It’s important to keep the number of experiences realistic given the time frame of each position. I'll adjust the number of experiences to 7-8 for each role while maintaining realism based on the amount of time you’ve spent in each position. I'll balance key accomplishments and responsibilities while making sure each project and experience fits into a reasonable timeline for each role. But always be sure to make most of experiences include the unique and real-sounding project name and its consequences.

 - Avoid a generic career summary.
 - In your bullet points, don't list responsibilities. List what you did to move the company or team forward, including key outcomes. Then, keep the achievements coming. The same idea applies to explaining your skills: Don't just make a list; talk about how you use them.
 - Incorporate metrics and details into your bullet points, focusing on your highlights, your "best of", your biggest achievements.
 - Use outcome metrics and scope of work to show your value and give context to your work.
 - Be sure to come up with project names that are natural-sounding while avoiding "X" like BridgeX or CrossChainX.

 - When giving me the project name, be sure to make it real and existing project with actual github repository so I can explain it in the next technical interview.
 - Do not eliminate any section from original resume. Just update experiences, skills and summary to the existing ones and replace the keyword from job description


You can use these my real projects to build experience in new resume.
- building LLM Twin
It is an AI character that learns to write like somebody by incorporating its style and personality into an LLM.

- Financial advisor platform
implemented a real-time feature pipeline that streams financial news into a vector DB deployed on AWS.

-Personalized recommendation system
I built a highly scalable and modular real-time personalized recommender on retail platform data.

We designed a strategy similar to what TikTok employs for short videos, which will be applied to H&M retail items.

We will present all the architectural patterns necessary for building an end-to-end TikTok-like personalized recommender for H&M fashion items, from feature engineering to model training to real-time serving.

- Automating Multi-Specialist Medical Diagnosis
Traditional medical diagnosis can be time-consuming and requires collaboration between different specialists. AI can help streamline this process by providing initial assessments based on medical reports, allowing doctors to focus on critical cases and improving efficiency. This project aims to:

- folderr.com
AI platform that customer can build their own multi-agent system
Output only updated plain resume text with new bullets integrated without any description, header or markdown formattings.

- HIPPA project - https://chartauditor.com/
The project has a goal of helping healthcare providers and other professionals detect and help identify healthcare compliance issues as they arise with the goal of delivering a detailed report on what is compliant and what is not, making it easier for healthcare providers to identify areas that need improvement and maintain regulatory compliance. 
It’s a system that simplifies the processing of ensuring compliance with state and insurance regulations for patient charts in the behavioral health field. 
The system works by first de-identifying the patient chart, which means removing any personal information that could identify the patient. then compares it to medical necessity guidelines and state guidelines to generate a detailed report.

- Credit default predictions
This project is to develop ML models to predict whether a customer will fail to repay their loan or credit card balance. This helps financial institutions assess credit risk, make informed lending decisions, and reduce the likelihood of financial losses by identifying potential defaulters in advance
