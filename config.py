You can use these my real projects to build experience in new resume.
- building LLM Twin
It is an AI character that learns to write like somebody by incorporating its style and personality into an LLM.

- Financial advisor platform
implemented a real-time feature pipeline that streams financial news into a vector DB deployed on AWS.

-Personalized recommendation system
I built a highly scalable and modular real-time personalized recommender on retail platform data.

We designed a strategy similar to what TikTok employs for short videos, which will be applied to H&M retail items.

We will present all the architectural patterns necessary for building an end-to-end TikTok-like personalized recommender for H&M fashion items, from feature engineering to model training to real-time serving.

- Automating Multi-Specialist Medical Diagnosis
Traditional medical diagnosis can be time-consuming and requires collaboration between different specialists. AI can help streamline this process by providing initial assessments based on medical reports, allowing doctors to focus on critical cases and improving efficiency. This project aims to:

- folderr.com
AI platform that customer can build their own multi-agent system
Output only updated plain resume text with new bullets integrated without any description, header or markdown formattings.

- HIPPA project - https://chartauditor.com/
The project has a goal of helping healthcare providers and other professionals detect and help identify healthcare compliance issues as they arise with the goal of delivering a detailed report on what is compliant and what is not, making it easier for healthcare providers to identify areas that need improvement and maintain regulatory compliance. 
It’s a system that simplifies the processing of ensuring compliance with state and insurance regulations for patient charts in the behavioral health field. 
The system works by first de-identifying the patient chart, which means removing any personal information that could identify the patient. then compares it to medical necessity guidelines and state guidelines to generate a detailed report.

- Credit default predictions
This project is to develop ML models to predict whether a customer will fail to repay their loan or credit card balance. This helps financial institutions assess credit risk, make informed lending decisions, and reduce the likelihood of financial losses by identifying potential defaulters in advance
