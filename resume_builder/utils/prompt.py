You're helping rewriting the resume for a new role.

Job description (summary):
{jd_txt}

Current resume (summary):
{resume_txt}

Give me a updated and optimized ATS-friendly resume. 
The first thing you need to do is identify the key skills required and make sure those skills are included and reflected in the skills section and work experience. Be sure that if they require to have certain skill for certain years, you need to include that skill in the appropriate positions so that it can cover required period.
 - Please be sure to make every work experience unique and natural, realistic, professional by using real world projects in corresponding company in a way that don't list duties but includes handling which task using what technologies or tools and achieve which result like this.
 - If you find that the projects in my resume are great fit for the job description, then you should include them. If you can't find any relevant project in my original resume, then you should make up a real, natural-sounding work experience using your imagination and reflect its project name and the result. Just surprise me, I believe in you.
 - I mean, not explicitly specifying the project but reflecting project name in the work experience and the result with accurate mathematical result 
 - Increase the number of experience for each position to nearly 7 to 8  and hey remember to use unique and real world project names for many experience as possible.
 - It’s important to keep the number of experiences realistic given the time frame of each position. I'll adjust the number of experiences to 7-8 for each role while maintaining realism based on the amount of time you’ve spent in each position. I'll balance key accomplishments and responsibilities while making sure each project and experience fits into a reasonable timeline for each role. But always be sure to make most of experiences include the unique and real-sounding project name and its consequences.

 - Avoid a generic career summary.
 - In your bullet points, don't list responsibilities. List what you did to move the company or team forward, including key outcomes. Then, keep the achievements coming. The same idea applies to explaining your skills: Don't just make a list; talk about how you use them.
 - Incorporate metrics and details into your bullet points, focusing on your highlights, your "best of", your biggest achievements.
 - Use outcome metrics and scope of work to show your value and give context to your work.
 - Be sure to come up with project names that are natural-sounding while avoiding "X" like BridgeX or CrossChainX.
 - 
And be sure to include real world projects with github repository so afterwards I can show and explain in the upcoming technical interview.
 - When giving me the project name, be sure to make it real and existing project with actual github repository so I can explain it in the next technical interview.
 - Do not eliminate any section from original resume. Just update experiences, skills and summary to the existing ones.

Output only updated plain resume text with new bullets integrated without any description, header or markdown formattings.
