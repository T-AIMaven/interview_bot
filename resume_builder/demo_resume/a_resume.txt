I am an ambitious Senior AI Engineer, with 10 years of experience in the Software Development industry. 
My passion for Artificial Intelligence research and development ignited at its very beginning in America. Since then, I’ve been keen on architecting, designing, and implementing top-of-the-line software solutions tailored to the unique needs of businesses. 
My commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements has enabled me to exceed the evolving demands of the digital business landscape. 
My biggest differentiator is my expertise - based upon best practices study, a non-conventional approach that goes beyond the latest tech trends, and proven solutions that best fit business objectives. Whether we’re talking about Product Development, driving projects as a Contractor, I’m enthusiastic about delivering results that transcend expectations. 
My proficiency in AI, MLOps, and System Architecture are not just skill sets. They are components that bridge the gap between real-world solutions and advanced algorithmic strategies.
