? Implemented expertise in implementing a sequential request processing system with a strong emphasis on low latency,  adopting an online real-time inference deployment architecture to enhance overall performance and responsiveness.
? Designed cloud-service/microservice architecture by splitting the ML service into a REST API server for business logic and an optimized LLM microservice, leveraging powerful machines and various engines to enhance latency and memory usage, thereby facilitating quick adaptation of the infrastructure based on different LLM sizes.
? Demonstrated a comprehensive approach by integrating Graph RAG with Neo4j within the business microservice, incorporating advanced RAG techniques to optimize the pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval steps, resulting in enhanced accuracy and improved response, implementing binay quantization solution improving RAG search to 40x faster.
? Implemented a highly efficient deployment strategy for the LLM microservice on AWS SageMaker, utilizing Hugging Face’s Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) to enhance model inference. This robust infrastructure supported scalable, secure, and efficient real-time predictions through critical components such as SageMaker endpoints, model configuration, and inference components. By leveraging the Text Generation Inference (TGI) engine, the system achieved superior computational efficiency via tensor and dynamic batching for leading open-source LLMs like Mistral, Llama, and Falcon, accomplished optimizing performance with flash-attention, minimizing model size through model parallelism and weight quantization, enhancing throughput with speculative decoding, continuous batching, accelerating weight loading using safetensors, and enabling real-time interactions via token streaming, culminating in a responsive and effective LLM serving solution and achieving speedups of 2-4x or more.
? Developed and implemented fine-tuning process with Unsloth, a high-performance library, utilizing custom kernels, accelerating training by 2-5x and significantly reducing memory usage by up to 80%. 
? Engineered a business microservice using FastAPI, initially deployed to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), involving Dockerization of the application, pushing the Docker image to AWS ECR, and configuring the deployment, while also orchestrating ML pipelines using ZenML / Airflow, storing and versioning ML pipelines as outputs, and attaching metadata to artifacts for better observability.
? Utilized advanced profiling tools to identify costly lines of code and uncover performance blind spots in local programs and Kubernetes clusters running on Linux, successfully optimizing CPU, GPU, and I/O performance, which led to an estimated 20% reduction in infrastructure costs.
? By integrating Ragas’s strengths in production monitoring and LLM-assisted metrics with ARES’s configurable evaluation process and classifier-based assessments, enhanced evaluation capabilities, achieving quick iterations and in-depth, customized evaluations that significantly improve performance outcomes.
? Exhibited strong leadership abilities by mentoring junior staff, enhancing their communication skills, and encouraging professional development.

I adopted MLOps best practices, including Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD, monitoring, experiment tracking, and model registries, ensuring the system is reproducible, testable, and trackable and deployed a scalable and cost-effective asynchronous batch architecture on AWS ECS and SQS, dynamically scaling based on job volume and achieving a 52% reduction in AWS costs.
? Designed 4-stage architecture to build a system that can handle recommendations from a catalog of millions of
items and two-tower model, a flexible neural network design that creates embeddings for users and items and optimized deploying ML models using Auto scaling, model optimization/parallelism/quantization, implementing a strategy similar to what TikTok employs for short videos, which will be applied to H&M retail items.
? Enhanced recommender systems by integrating advanced evaluation metrics such as NDCG, Precision@K, Recall@K, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), providing nuanced insights into model performance and user relevance, ultimately improving user satisfaction and engagement.
? Deployed real-time recommendations using Hopsworks Serverless and KServe, a runtime engine for serving predictive and generative ML models on Kubernetes, which simplifies autoscaling, networking, health checks, and server configuration while providing advanced features like GPU autoscaling and canary rollouts; through KServe, I successfully implemented two distinct services— the query encoder service and the ranking service—resulting in improved model performance and responsiveness in production.
